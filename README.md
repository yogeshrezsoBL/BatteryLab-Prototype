# ðŸ”‹ BatteryLAB Prototype

**Recipe in â†’ Performance out.**  
BatteryLAB Prototype is the first step toward an AI-powered tool that connects electrode **recipes** with battery **performance predictions**.  

This prototype combines:
- âœ… **MATLAB hybrid physicsâ€“ML models** for degradation prediction  
- âœ… **Streamlit interface** for interactive testing  
- âœ… A vision of fast, data-driven battery design
