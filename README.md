# 🔋 BatteryLAB Prototype

**Recipe in → Performance out.**  
BatteryLAB Prototype is the first step toward an AI-powered tool that connects electrode **recipes** with battery **performance predictions**.  

This prototype combines:
- ✅ **MATLAB hybrid physics–ML models** for degradation prediction  
- ✅ **Streamlit interface** for interactive testing  
- ✅ A vision of fast, data-driven battery design  

---

## 🚀 Features
- Upload or define **battery parameters / recipes**
- Predict **early degradation trends** and state-of-health
- Hybrid modeling: physics-based + machine learning
- Prototype Streamlit app for scouts & demos
- **[Try the Live Prototype]**
